For greater certainty,<br/>Confidential Information includes all employee, customer or client personal information, technical<br/>data, unpublished know-how, techniques, records, formulae, processes, sketches, photographs,<br/>plans, drawings, specifications, samples, reports, manuals, documents, prototypes, hardware,<br/>software and other equipment, working materials, findings, inventions and ideas, whether patentable<br/>or not, whether they be trade secrets or not and whether they be in written, graphic, oral, electronic<br/>or any other form, that are now or hereafter owned, licensed or otherwise acquired by the Company<br/>Group. <br/>B. The Worker may develop, conceive, generate or contribute to, in the course of employment<br/>or engagement with the Company, alone and/or jointly with others, tangible and intangible property<br/>relating to actual or anticipated business and research and development of the Company Group, or<br/>that is suggested by or result from work performed for or on behalf of the Company Group, in any<br/>fields, which property includes software, hardware, know-how, designs, techniques, documentation<br/>and other material regardless of the form or media in or on which it is stored, some or all of which<br/>property may be protected by patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade-marks, industrial designs or<br/>mask works or any common law or statutory right anywhere in the world (which tangible and<br/>intangible property is collectively referred to in this Agreement as &#8220; Proprietary Property &#8221;). <br/>THEREFORE , in consideration of the Worker&#8217;s employment or engagement with the Company and<br/>other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged by the<br/>Worker, the parties agree as follows:<br/>1.

(b)  Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed, or the disclosure of which to<br/>regulators is protected, by law, whether under an order of a court or government tribunal, statutory<br/>provision or other legal process, provided that, where such disclosure is required of the Worker, the<br/>Worker informs the Company of such requirement as soon as the Worker becomes aware of the<br/>requirement and in sufficient time to allow the Company to take such steps as are lawfully available<br/>to the Company to avoid or limit such disclosure by the Worker. <br/>2.

Such return or destruction shall include all originals and all copies of the Confidential<br/>Information and Proprietary Property, in whatever medium or form, that is then in the control or<br/>possession of the Worker. Upon request by the Company, the Worker shall certify, by way of<br/>affidavit or statutory declaration, that all such Confidential Information and Proprietary Property<br/>has been returned or destroyed, as applicable.

The Worker&#8217;s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Company<br/>is limited to monetary damages and the Worker shall not make any claim in respect of any rights to<br/>or interest in any Confidential Information or Proprietary Property. The Worker hereby waives,<br/>relinquishes and conveys to the Company any and all claims of any nature whatsoever, which the<br/>Worker now or hereafter has for infringement of any proprietary rights assigned to the Company. The<br/>Worker acknowledges that it would be difficult to compute the monetary loss to the Company arising<br/>from a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Worker and that, accordingly, the<br/>Company shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to or<br/>instead of monetary damages, without the necessity of establishing that monetary damages would<br/>be inadequate. <br/>13. The Worker&#8217;s employment or engagement with the Company is subject to the terms and<br/>conditions of this Agreement.

The Worker confirms that he or she had the opportunity to confer with an independent legal<br/>advisor if he or she so wished, in advance of signing this Agreement. The Worker further confirms<br/>that he or she has read this Agreement and the Worker accepts and agrees to be bound by its<br/>terms. <br/>18. The headings herein are for convenience only and do not interpret this Agreement, the word &#8220;<br/>including &#8221; or &#8220; include &#8221;, when following any general statement or term, is not to be construed as<br/>limiting the general statement or term to the specific items or matters set forth or to similar items or<br/>matters, but rather as permitting the general statement or term to refer to all other items or matters<br/>that could reasonably fall within its broadest possible scope, and the word &#8220; or &#8221; does not imply an<br/>exclusive relationship between the matters being connected. </p>
